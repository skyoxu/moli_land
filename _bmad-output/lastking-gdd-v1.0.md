## 1. Document Info
- Project: Lastking
- Version: 1.0
- Date: 2026-02-09
- Platform: Steam (Windows only)
- Engine: Godot 4 + C#

## 2. Vision
Lastking is a high-pressure single-player tower defense game focused on macro decisions: economy, construction, and army composition under escalating night assaults.

## 3. Experience Pillars
1. High pressure with readable rules
2. Macro strategy over micro control
3. Meaningful day-night rhythm
4. Replay value through randomized map pressure

## 4. Core Loop
1. Day phase (4 min): build, upgrade, recruit, set rally points
2. Night phase (2 min): defend one incoming wave
3. Post-night: pick one reward from 3 choices
4. Repeat until day 15 survival or castle destroyed

## 5. Win/Lose Conditions
- Win: survive through day 15 boss night
- Lose: castle HP reaches 0

## 6. Match Structure
- Match duration: 60-90 min
- Total days: 15
- Special nights:
  - Day 5: Elite Night
  - Day 10: Elite Night

- Day1 base budget: 50
- Daily growth: 120% multiplicative
- Elite and Boss budgets calculated independently
- Enemy subtypes: Fast / Armored / Ranged / Self-destruct
